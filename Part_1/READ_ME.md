<h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        This is my first day learn JS, HTML and CSS. Today is July, 27, 2025. 
        I had no idea how powerful and exciting it would be. With just a computer and a browser, 
        I was ready to learn how websites are built. 
        I started with the three core technologies of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
        Although I was a little nervous, I was more excited to finally begin building something real with code.
    </p>

<h1>Body</h1>
    <p>
        I began with HTML – the structure of every webpage. 
        I learned how to use tags like to add headings, paragraphs, and links. 
        It felt like I was giving bones to a website. Next, I explored CSS, which was all about design and style. 
        By adding some simple CSS rules, I changed text colors, adjusted layouts, and made the page look more visually appealing. 
        I was amazed how just a few lines of code could transform a plain page into something creative.
        The most exciting part was when I wrote my first line of JavaScript. 
        I used document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!"; to make text appear on the screen. 
        For the first time, the page responded to my code! 
        I realized JavaScript brings a website to life, allowing it to react and interact with users. 
        I combined all three – HTML for the structure, CSS for the appearance, and JavaScript for interactivity – and created a simple webpage that said “Hello World!” and changed color when I clicked a button.
    </p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p> 
        That first day was just the beginning, but it opened my eyes to how the web works. 
        I discovered that even simple code could create meaningful results, and I felt empowered knowing I was building something with my own hands. 
        Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript gave me a solid foundation and inspired me to keep going deeper. 
        Looking back, I smile at how such a small start led to such a big passion.
