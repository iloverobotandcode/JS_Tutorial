<h2>5 - Demo 5: Read more article function</h2>
<p>Example article: In recent years, technology has taken over our daily lives. Many
people claim that they simply couldn’t imagine a life without the
internet and social media. So are your online friendships doing you
more harm than good?
It has become commonplace in our society to argue that
technology is the reason for people being socially distant and
experiencing loneliness. Some studies do show a correlation
between social media usage and low self-esteem, although there is
no solid proof showing that this is the main cause. Indeed, others

        you make a point of communicating with all of them for at least
        two hours every week, you can’t even call it a real friendship. The
        strength of an offline relationship lies in the experiences you share
        together in the real world.

        True, it could be argued that online relationships are not
        particularly meaningful, but saying that social media friendships
        are false is not correct. ‘You and your real friends may not
